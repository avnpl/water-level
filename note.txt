Nodemcu is  connected to the PC and gets power through the usb cable. Same goes for the Arduino Uno

The trigger and echo pins of the ultrasonic hc-sr04  sensor are conneted to the nodemcu since nodemcu is
the one responsible for calculating the distance.(copy ultrasonic sensor ka working from internet
and the site)  It further acts a web server on the local wifi network when it's supplied power.
It returns the distance at the current moment when it receives a request. The purpose of the Arduino is
just to supply the 5v supply required by the sensor. nodemcu only functions at 3v and the sensor needs 5v.
So an alternate power supply of 5v was required to be connected to the sensor

We run a React app made using JS on the local network. The app polls or sends request to the nodemcu server
every 5 seconds for the distance. The app then stores all the distances, calculates the amount of water level
in terms of percentage. Using the stored distances between the sensor and the water level, it calculates the
amount of water used in real time and displays it along with the cost of the used water

The project can be easily modified to fit any kind of tanks by changing the constants in the app such as the max
height of the tank, the cross-sectional area of the tank, the local wifi network, the cost of water per litre

Future scope includes making the system available for the whole internet instead of the local network and using
it for more liquids than just work and thus be used in other industries
